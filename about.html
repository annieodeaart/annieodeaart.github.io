			<h1>About The Artist</h1>
			<hr>
			<h3>Art is a passion I have grown to love more and more over the last few years of my life. The ability art has to help me express my emotions in a personal way is something I value about it. I love that I can dedicate endless amounts of time to perfecting my work until it is exactly what I want it to be. It allows me to draw on my creativity and create art that represents who I am and what I love. I enjoy making art that incorporates ideas from my personal life, such as paintings of friends and family, or photos that I take. This website is to share all of the artwork I have created over time.t<h3>
